### Functionality & Features

My Portfolio Website was developed with the idea of it's presentation and functions to be simple, yet fun.

##### Colour

Using the website [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), I chose my theme of Orange, Dark Grey and Green to not over-stimulate the idea of simple while also giving the impression of fun.

Orange being the main colour, it is styled on most components. Dark Grey is both the font colour and the background colour for both the header and footer. Green is used as a highlight, for example:

- Letting the user know what page they are on by changing the navigation background colour from Orange to Green,
- When hovering over certain elements such as text links and buttons, they change from Orange to Green

##### Typography

For all font in the website, I used Montserrat, while sans-serif is the fall back option.

I used Monterrat as it didn't stray too far from the norm of what most sites we use, while also showing a sense of professionism in the midst of all the colours

##### Layout

For the layout, I didn't want to overcomplicate the design by adding too many elements for what I intended to be simple. By implementing the current layout, it gives the user ease of looking at any page and being able to understand what is displayed, especially since it is only a portfolio website. 

My intention isn't to impress users with complicated functions, that is what the projects are for. I wanted the layout to leave an impression of who I am and what I have achieved.

##### Animations

I decided not to go too over the top with hover animations. The only animations I integrated relate to elements that need to react to help the user know that you can click on it. The elements that react are:

- Some text in the about me page. For example, there is "Coder Academy" text that is highlighted orange but when hovered it turns green. Once clicked on, it takes the user to the site.
- Buttons: Buttons on all page either scale up in size and change color or just change color.

These animations/reactions give the user a hint of "fun" as well as letting them know that you can click on the elements

##### Components 

I used a variety of components to create this site. Below are what was used:

- Header - To title the website/display my name on all pages
- Nav - Used on all pages to help direct the user
- Main - Used on all pages for most, if not all content to reside in outside of the header and footer
- Section - Used on all pages for a variety of different components such as the project cards. Used instead of "div"
- Img - Used for:
    - Home Page: For the profile photo
    - About Page: For the Brisbane City photo
    - Contact Page: For the LinkedIn, GitHub & Email section
    - Portfolio Page: For each project card
- Button - Used on Home, Contact and Portfolio page
- Input, Textarea - Used for the form on the Contact page
- Footer - To show the copyright statement on all pages
- Anchor tag - Used to direct the user to a different part of the page, different page or to a different site
